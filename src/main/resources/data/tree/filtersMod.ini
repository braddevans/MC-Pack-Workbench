# Tree Group Filters for FANCY VIEW
# 
# Filters for mod files

# Filters are used to select which files go to each group.
# Make sure the groups are defined in your group config file!

# ~~~ Filter syntax: ~~~
# group = filter | otherFilter | filterWithWildCard*

# * ... matches anything, even a dot = can match recursively.
# ^ ... a short for "assets.minecraft"

# Group "NULL" -> matched assets will hide
# Filter "NULL" -> no files will match

# IMPORTANT: Deepest groups must be matched first
