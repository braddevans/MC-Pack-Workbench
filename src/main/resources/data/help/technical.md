# Technical details

## Working directory

RPW lives in a folder called `.mcRPW`, which is located in the same place as Minecraft's one, `.minecraft`.

On linux, that would be `~/.mcRPW`, on Windows `%APPDATA%/.mcRPW`.

## Used software

The RPW's GUI is made using *SwingX* and the images are scaled up or down with a library called *Thumbnailator*. Other
used libraries are *GSON* and
*MarkDown4j*.

The built-in text editors are based on an amazing highlighter component called
*RSyntaxTextArea*.

## Licence & Sharing

The tool is released as a free software under the terms of the MIT license.

The used libraries, however, have various licenses, so be respectful to them.
