# Understanding resource packs

To use RPW efficiently, it's important to know how resource packs work.

All the resources in Minecraft are organized in directories, either in the jar file, or in the `assets` folder. It's
divided into those two simply because sound files are HUGE and they don't need to be re-downloaded each time a new
version is released. Since resource packs can contain both sounds and textures, RPW treats them as equal and shows them
together.

## What's in a pack

Each pack contains:

* Info file `pack.mcmeta`
* PNG icon `pack.png`
* `assets` folder with the actual resources

Files in the `assets` folder are structured exactly like those in Minecraft, so when a pack is in use, it essentially
replaces some of the Vanilla resources by the custom ones.

## Using multiple packs

When you use more than one pack at once, Minecraft first tries to get the assets from the topmost pack, then proceeds to
the second and so on until it reaches Vanilla again.

That's why you *shouldn't* put copies of everything into your packs - it would make it hard to combine your pack with
others.
